                BuJoApp is an amazing system that keeps a record of everything you could ever want to toss at it.
                It can be your task manager, sketchbook, journal, idea catcher, and much more! The BuJoApp is a
                organizational system in your browser that keeps track of anything you would like to in an coherent
                way. Our app is designed to be simple. We belive that simplicity is a wey to to be focused and
                productove.
                BuJoApp base on regular logging and categorizing entries into tasks, events and notes.
                Tasks are represented by <i class="ui circle icon"></i>, events by <i
                    class="ui circle outline icon"></i> and notes by
                <i class="ui minus icon"></i>.<br> You can add a date to an entry - it will appear in a proper daily and
                monthly log, or you can leave it
                without date, then you will find this entry in the backlog.<br>
                Every entry can have one of five states: incomplete represented by basic icon, complete represented by
                <i class="ui close icon"></i>,
                irrelevant - represented by <i class="ui ban icon"></i> - these entries are also automaticly moved to
                designed log
                to not distract you while checking your daily or monthly log. You can always change state of particular
                entry to
                move it back to another log. While changing date of the entry, it will be automaticly assigned with <i
                    class="ui right chevron icon"></i>, and if you decide to remove date from entry, it will be moved to
                backlog with <i class="ui left chevron icon"></i> icon.
                If you find one of your tasks more important than other, you can mark it with exclamation mark
                <i class="ui exclamation icon"></i>. A star <i class="ui star icon"></i>
                can be used to emphazise inspirational meaning of entry. For more information please visit websit Bullet
                Journal wbsite (link below).
